A QR code (short for Quick Response code) is an array of black and white squares or pixels set in a grid that stores data for a machine to read. A smartphone or camera can quickly process the information contained in a QR code’s specific arrangement of pixels, making it a convenient way to store and access data.

If you’ve used a QR code to access a Wi-Fi network or pull up a menu on your phone, these square codes may seem like modern wizardry, but they were actually invented all the way back in 1994 by the Japanese auto manufacturing company Denso Wave. Initially, QR codes were used to enable high-speed scanning and tracking of components during the assembly process.
